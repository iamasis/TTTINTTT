# TTTINTTT (TicTacToe in TicTacToe)
This game is different from normal ticktactoe game. Difference between normal tictactoe and tictactoe in tictactoe is that.
Here we have total 9 normal tictactoe board.
[0-8] denotes total 9 tictactoe boards, [0-2] denotes row of minitictactoe board, [0-2] denotes row of minitictactoe board.
At first time the first can choose any mini tictactoe board.
let's say that first player plays its turn in [2][2] in chosen mini tictactoe board(let's say 7) then second player auto directed to 1 mini tictactoe to 3 mini tictactoe board. then second player lets say plays [1][3] in 3 mini tictactoe then the first player auto directed to 5 mini tictactoe (imagine 3X3 matrix and each element its itself a tictactoe).
player won when they won mini tictictoe rowWise or colWise or diagonalWise
